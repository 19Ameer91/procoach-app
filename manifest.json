The HTML tag you wrote:

<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">


is used to link a Web App Manifest file to your website or Progressive Web App (PWA).

What it does
The manifest.json file contains metadata about your web app, such as:
Name and short name
Icons for different devices
Theme color and background color
Start URL when the app is launched
Display mode (fullscreen, standalone, minimal-ui, browser)
This allows browsers to install your web app to a device’s home screen and control how it behaves when launched.
Example manifest.json

Here’s a minimal but valid example:

{
  "name": "My Awesome App",
  "short_name": "AwesomeApp",
  "start_url": "/index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#2196f3",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icons/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}

How to use it
Place manifest.json in your project root (or adjust the href path).
Add the <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"> tag inside your <head> section.
Ensure your server serves it with the correct MIME type:
Content-Type: application/manifest+json

For PWAs, also add a service worker to enable offline capabilities.

✅ Tip: Without a valid manifest, your app won’t be installable as a PWA.

Do you want me to prepare that?
